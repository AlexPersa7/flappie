# Flappie

## Overview

Basecall Fast5 reads using _flip-flop_ basecalling.  

Brief description in non-slang, explicit terms that facilitate the biological understanding of the data analysis provided by the software. Few sentences. Include biological concepts if applicable. **Link out to ReadtheDocs** specific to the repository and a explanation for further information see, `here <https://readthedocs.org/>`

## Features

Bullet point the features that distinguish it from pre-existing or similar software, what advances have been made and how it enables the user to get what they want from the sequence data.

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- ...
- Feature n


# Getting Started

Describe a succint 101 on how to install, run and get software going.

## Input and Output

Details on sequence structure e.g. fast5, unaligned, ccs-like equivalent for ONT, raw data, capital/lower case, named, ordered, barcoded etc. Details on output structure of file and sequence and any formats that may apply - can these be reinserted into subsequent software/builds for refinement etc.? - REPORTING  file format and structure for APIs only.

## Depedencies

Software/hardware/usage depedencies, bullet point if easier. i.e. python revisions etc. 

## Installation

Describe the stages necessary for installing software on various platforms/OS etc. exporting/importing files, how to run/where to run in which software/browswer etc.

### Compilation From Source

Building the environment and compiling the software/pipeline/api/tool etc. from source

### Alternative Installation Methods

Any other installation method.

## Usage

Examples of code parametes and runs
